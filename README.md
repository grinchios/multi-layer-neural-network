# Multi Layer Neural Network
A multi layer neural network written in Python, which can be trained to solve the XOR problem.
Currently only two layers but will be going to a custom layer and custom node system with adaptable levels of intelligence and more inputs.


Adapted from Milo Harpers solution, brought into Python3 and futher upgraded by Callum Pritchard
