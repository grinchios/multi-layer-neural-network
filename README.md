# Multi Layer Neural Network
## What is this
A multi layer neural network written in Python, which can be trained to solve the XOR problem.
Currently only two layers but will be going to a custom layer and custom node system with
adaptable levels of intelligence and more inputs.

## TODO
reading files for training and use later
Better ini file
Less dependencies and imports
Adaptable neurons (more or less layers and inputs)
General input data
Species support
Multi-core support
Nicer interface
